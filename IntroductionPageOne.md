# Welcome to Runit-for-LFS #

Welcome to the runit-for-lfs project. Our goal for this project is to provide a new init and service management system for [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.com) without the need for extra, rebuilt, and intrusive software such as that of [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/). We understand [sysvinit](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/sysvinit) needs a successor, but not a replacement. Our research has led us to use Gerrit Pape's [Runit](http://smarden.org/runit) to provide a modernized init and service supervision suite for GNU/Linux.

In this wiki, you'll find lots of information on:

  * Deployment tactics for service supervision.
  * How-tos write service run, finish, and log scripts.
  * Helpful hints for deployment.
  * Resolving dependencies.

This wiki will expand and change as needed to provide more, and if necessary, better information.
